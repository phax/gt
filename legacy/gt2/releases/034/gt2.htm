<a name="12"></a>
<h3>1.2 What is GT2</h1>
<div class="borded">
GT2 is a file detection utility that detects all kind of file types according to their binary signature.<br>
<div class="borded_l"><b>Example:</b> GT will recognize your ZIP file even if it is named &quot;testfile.avi&quot; if the first 4 bytes in the file are PK\x03\x04 - whatever this mean ;-)</div>
It is different from standard Windows filetype detection since it does not consider the file's extension by default.<br>
So if you ever stumble across a file that you don't know what it is, run GT2 on it and you will hopefull know what it is.
</div>
<!-- end of What's it -->
<!-- start of Where to find -->
<a name="13"></a>
<h3>1.3 Where to find GT2</h1>
<div class="borded">
GT2 does not create a start menu entry because it is not (yet) an interactive application. It can be accessed from the commandline by typing &quot;gt2&quot; or by selecting &quot;Detect with GT2...&quot; from the Windows Explorer context menu.

Author's note: This reference is just at the beginning. It will take some versions until is contains most of the details, but at least I started :)

<h3>2.1 Commandline switches</h3>
<div class="borded_l">
The following table contains an overview of the supported commandline switches and an short explanation what it does. A commandline switch can be at any position within the commandline as long as it starts with a slash '/' or a minus '-' character. The commandline switch names are case sensitive: /s is different from /S.<br>
<span class="info">If you want to scan a file that starts with a '-' character, you can scan it by prefixing the files name with &quot;.\&quot;</span>
<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>Switch</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/?</td>
    <td>Show an overview of all available commandline switches.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/alldrives</td>
    <td>Scans all drives (both fixed drives and network drives) for the filemask(s) you specified on the commandline. This flag automatically starts at your drive C: and scans all directories for the given filemasks, continues with your next drive until it handled all drives.<br>
If you use this switch, your filemask may not contain any directory (e.g. images\*.gif) nor any direct drive name (e.g. c:\*.tmp).<br>
This switch implies the subdirectory switch (/s).<br>
<span class="warning">Note: Currently the file system is scanned for each mask you pass. So if you want to scan for some files it will take some extra time, because each drive is scanned more than once.<br>
This issue will only be fixed on demand (if somebody except me is using this switch).</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/allfixed</td>
    <td>Scans all fixed drives. Fixed means that the disk cannot be removed from the drive. The rest is according to /alldrives above.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/allnetwork</td>
    <td>Scans all network drives. Network means that the drive is a remote (network) drive. The rest is according to /alldrives above.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/bufsize##</td>
    <td>Set the internal pre-read buffer size to ##.<br>
<span class="warning">Be careful when using this switch because changing it to a value that is too small GT2 will probably fail to detect some files whereas setting it to a value that is too large the execution speed will decrease.</span><br>
The default value is 4096 bytes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/cachestats</td>
    <td>Show caching information after all information was printed. This switch has only informational purposes and does not alter anything. I used it to determine the best buffersize (see /bufsize).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/exemod</td>
    <td>This switch applies only to EXE files. By default the complete EXE information is listed but with this switch only the modifier/compressor/etc. are printed.<br>
<span class="info">To list the modifieres of all EXE files in the current directory, you can use the following command:<br>
<span class="code">gt2 *.exe /l /exemod</span></span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/flushoutput</td>
    <td>By default, all output of a file is cached and than printed at once, because this is faster than printing each character separately. If you pass this switch, the internal output caching is disabled and each output is printed directly to the desired output device.<br>
<span class="warning">This switch will heavily decrease the application speed if you scan many files.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/fte##</td>
    <td>This is a very high sophisticated switch that applies only to DOS executables (for NE EXEs, PE EXEs or SYS files see below). If sets the signature comparison engine tolerance to ##.<br>
This switch may be helpful if you have a DOS EXE file that is modified/packed by a program that is not recognized by GT. It will increase the scanning tolerance and may give you at least a hint what it could be.<br>
The default value is 3</td>

By default the name of the file is matched to an internal list of special names if it could not be identified.</td>

<h3>2.2 Configuration file</h3>
<div class="borded_l">
The configuration file is a very handy thing that helps you applying common commandline switches. Every switch that can be passed on the commandline can also be written in the configuration file.<br>
The configuration file is called <span class="code">gt2.cfg</span> and needs to be located in the same directory as the executable file.<br>
The following is an example how the configuration file can look like:<br>
<div class="borded"><span class="code">
<span class="comment">;</span><br>
<span class="comment">; GT2 configuration file</span><br>
<span class="comment">;</span><br>
<br>
/fte0  <span class="comment">; EXE</span><br>
/ftn0  <span class="comment">; NE</span><br>
/ftp0  <span class="comment">; PE</span><br>
/fts0  <span class="comment">; SYS</span><br>
