# GetTyp legacy

##GETTYP
This folder contains packed versions of the original GetTyp written in Turbo Pascal.
It is a DOS application :)

##gt2000
These are the first steps towards moving GetTyp to C++.
The source files are compressed with IMP from http://technelysium.com.au/wp/imp-file-archiver/
For sanity reasons I added the first and the last source version as RAR as well.

##geteqexe
geteqexe is a tool to find similarities in EXE files - comparable to geew.exe in the C++ version.
Btw. .ARJ files can be opened e.g. with WinRAR :)
