GT2 0.35
GT2 is a file detection utility that detects all kind of file types according to their binary signature.
Example: GT will recognize your ZIP file even if it is named "test file.avi" if the first 4 bytes in the file are PK\x03\x04.
It is different from standard Windows file type detection since it does not consider the file's extension by default. So if you ever stumble across a file that you don't know what it is, run GT2 on it and you will hopefully know what it is.
