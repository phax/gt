         02.06.1999
                         seems like I was wrong with the MS HTML format
                           in reality it was only the MS Visual C++ help
                         really added MS HTML help file format
                         fixed bug in LZH archive listing

                      �>   ThanX to e95 for the suggestion
                         I discovered that /OUT should also be able to
                           redirect the output to the printer, by calling
                           /outPRN or so but this is untested!!

                           where found
                         changed handling of /FILE parameter - now it's
                           a nice implementation and official :)
                         renamed switch /FILE to /OUT because of problems

                           check - this should be an enhancement in detection
         10.04.1999
                         added switch /OVER which only works together with
                           switch /FILE and can be use in the config file

         06.04.1999
             -           moved to my new home so I had no time to do much
         09.04.1999      only worked on GetTyp UI for Windows (MFC)

         05.04.1999
                         added very crucial any very experimental switch
                           /FILEfoo which is able to write the output to
                           the specified file "foo". Not officially
                           documented because it's a hack ;)
